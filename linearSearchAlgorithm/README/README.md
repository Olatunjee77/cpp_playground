# The Linear Search Algorithm
An Algorithm to search for an element in a sorted array*

## Steps involved in the linear search

### The searchArray() funtion
1- The algorithm works by Iterating over the sorted array using the for loop.  
2- It compares every element to the key(searched element).  
3- If the current element equals the key, It returns the index at which the key is found and the program terminates.  
4- Else it says the element is not in the array.
